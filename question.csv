What is blockchain technology?;Blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system that records transactions across multiple computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. It ensures transparency and security through cryptographic hashing.
How does a blockchain work?;A blockchain operates by creating a chain of blocks where each block contains a list of transactions. Once a block is filled with transactions, it is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a chain. This chain is replicated across a network of nodes, ensuring consistency and security.
What are the main components of a blockchain?;Blocks: Contain transaction data. Chain: Links blocks in a sequential manner. Nodes: Computers that maintain and validate the blockchain. Consensus Mechanism: Protocols that ensure all nodes agree on the blockchain state.
What is a smart contract?;A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It automatically enforces and executes the terms of the contract when predefined conditions are met.
What is a consensus mechanism?;A consensus mechanism is a protocol used to achieve agreement on the blockchain network about the validity of transactions and the state of the ledger. Common mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT).
What is Proof of Work (PoW)?;Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism where nodes compete to solve complex mathematical problems. The first node to solve the problem gets to add the block to the blockchain and is rewarded with cryptocurrency. Bitcoin uses PoW.
What is Proof of Stake (PoS)?;Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral. PoS is more energy-efficient compared to PoW.
What are the advantages of blockchain technology?;Transparency: All transactions are visible on the blockchain. Security: Cryptographic algorithms ensure data integrity and security. Decentralization: Reduces the risk of a single point of failure. Immutability: Once recorded, data cannot be altered or deleted.
What are the disadvantages of blockchain technology?;Scalability Issues: Processing transactions can be slow and costly. High Energy Consumption: PoW consensus mechanisms can be energy-intensive. Complexity: Implementation and management can be complex. Regulatory Uncertainty: Blockchain technology faces varying regulatory challenges across different jurisdictions.
What is a cryptocurrency?;A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on a blockchain. It is decentralized and typically not controlled by any central authority. Examples include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple.
